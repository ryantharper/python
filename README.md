# Python Projects

You've reached the readme of my Python Projects repo. I upload some projects here from time to time.

###IMDb Extractor
For this I used the Python packages urllib2 and json (with sys just to exit). I chose to do this to step into the world of getting 
information from websites with Python. 

In this project I learned:
* How to get information from JSON and how to use it in Python
* Extended my knowledge in functions (may have went too overboard on the functions)
* How to open webpages using urllib2

This was version 2 of the program. Version 1 was a jumbled mess of if statements with one function (listJSONLoads)

####Stay tuned for more!
